# Suggestions on what to include in GitHub workshop
Like Ana (she tagged me as a reviewer), I would like to learn some Git commands so I can feel smart like this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1GmQdWzSRU And I would like to understand the GitHub interface better. It does not make sense to me. For example, if something is a "branch" of something else, I would expect there to be a view where the hierarchical relationship of the branches is shown, but there doesn't seem to be one. This made me unsure as to whether I actually completed the assignment, the part about creating the new branch off of my previous branch, properly. (Maybe I didn't.) Also I just created the new branch "Homework-for-Oct-18" for the homework assignment and the screen says that the branch was updated 5 days ago. This makes me feel like I can't trust what the software is telling me.
