# Suggestions for the next GitHub demo

It would be good to build off the basic understanding folks now have of working in GitHub. Some possible future demos could include using VS Code and GitHub Desktop, as well as any extensions for these that tech writers would find useful. I think it'd also be good to include an overview of DCOs. 

Also, personally, I'd like to learn how to use git commands to commit and/or create pull requests as a way to kick my knowledge up a notch or two.

Nice presentation today, thanks much for sharing!
